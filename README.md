### Markdown

Hello, my name is Conor McRae. 

Welcome to my Github page, where you can see my recent projects and labs. I worked with a variety of data sources this semester, ranging from airports in Alaska to fires in California, and housing in Baltimore.

I hope you enjoy looking at the maps that I have made over the past couple months.
